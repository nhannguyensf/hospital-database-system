# Discord API has a limited number of requests (bot requests) per day.
# If developers meet that quota, then Discord will put a temporal ban to your bot (24 hours)
# In order to avoid that, and only for testing, create unit test methods to test your functions
# without using the functionality provided by your bot. Once all your tests passed, then you can
# integrate these functions with your bot logic in main.py
